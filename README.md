# sign-up-form

### This is a sign-up form I designed for the Odin Project (theodinproject.com).
You can see the details of the project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form

The requirements for this project include creating a semi-functional sign-up form using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript with and emphasis on form styling.

This project taught me a lot about design and creating content that is repsonsive to different resolutions (give it a try on mobile!).

Time spent: 8 hours.
